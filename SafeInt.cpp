// The boring, repetitive part of setting up _member_ and _friend_ functions was done by
//   right-clicking in this file in C-Lion, and choosing "Generate -> Generate Definitions"
//   and then choosing either the class name (for members) or "top-level functions" (for friends, etc.)
//   and then selecting all the ones we want

    // and _not_   this .theValue = i;

// This isn't a method, so no "this" pointer is available.
// But, it is listed in the class (as "friend", so it does have access to private fields)
// Defining non-mutating operators as friends allows implicit type-casting of both operands

// Operator+= is in the class without "friend", so it's a method
// It gets access and has a "this" object (the left-hand side, in a += b)
// Defining mutator operators as methods prevents implicit type-casting of the left-hand side
// Note that, in C and C++, assignment operations are "right-associative" and produce a reference to their lhs, so
//      a = b = c = d+e;
//   is the same as
//      a = (b = (c = d+e));
