# MemoryManagementInC
This was a project done in C and C++ that allowed me to practive memory management. 
For one part of this project, I was able to effectivly store a number greater that MaxInteger in two places
For the other part of the project, I was bale to do the same thing, but expand on this by allowing the number to have infinite places to carry to
